This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}
data <- read.csv('data.csv')
data <- data.frame(data)
print(data)
```
We need to remove NA cells using na.omit(). 
Then, we turn 1 and 2 values diagnosis into 0 and 3-value into 1.

```{r}
Dfprediction = na.omit(data)
Dfprediction$diagnosis= 1*(Dfprediction$diagnosis == 3)
print(Dfprediction)

```

We split the dataset in two parts. Taking 80% of patients, we build a training dataset on which we will fit the parameters of our logistic model. On the remaining 20% of patients, we will evaluate the performance of our model.

```{r}
#Starting code
